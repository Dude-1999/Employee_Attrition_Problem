 # Here the data is for company X which is trying to control attrition. 
 
 
 * There are two sets of data: “Existing employees” and “Employees who have left”. Following attributes are available for every employee.
 
 
 #  Description:-
 
 1.  Satisfaction Level
 2.  Last evaluation
 3.  Number of projects
 4.  Average monthly hours
 5.  Time spent at the company
 6.  Whether they have had a work accident
 7.  Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
 8.  Departments (column sales)
 9.  Salary
10.  Whether the employee has left?

 Our objective is to find what type of employees are leaving and also which employees are prone to leave next. So I have used predictive analysis in order to solve this problem.
